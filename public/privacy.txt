1. What information do you collect?
    Your Google identity key is stored to uniquely identify you and painlessly login, along with a token unique to your login into this site. 
    This token cannot be used to log you in on other sites.

2. How do you use the information?
    Your identity key is used to keep your chip information, uploaded firmware, and chip firmware assignments unique and available only to you.

3. What information do you share?
    The only time a record of your accounts existence on this site will be used is during analytics - counting number of users, number of active users, avg number of chips/firmware uploads per user. 
    Again, nothing that makes your identity discernible will be used in this process.

4. How securely is this data stored?
    That depends on the owner of the site - you should only post data to this server that you're willing to have become public domain in the case of a breach.
